# DGA_domains_dataset

We extracted  a set of domains generated by 25 different DGA families from the Netlab Opendata Project repository (data.netlab.360.com/dga) and used Alexa as an authoritative source for benign domain names.
In total, we collected 675.000 domain names. 50% of the domains are DGA generated and 50% are Alexa domains.
The 337.500 malicious DNs are equally distributed among the 25 DGA families, thus we have 13.500 domains for each family. Among such DGAs, 13 are time dependent algorithms and 12 are time independent ones.
